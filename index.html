                        <p class="lead">
                            I am an AI/ML Engineer who is motivated by machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. 
                            Learning new topics within these areas is what drives me.

                    <p class="lead">
                    During my Master's degree, I worked on computer vision techniques for detecting road lanes in autonomous vehicles. It was then that I first became interested in deep learning. It's clearly the future! Encouraged by my supervisor's foresight, I immersed myself in the field, taking machine learning courses and quickly finding myself drawn to the challenge.

                    This path led me to pursue a PhD in human motion prediction, in which I explored how deep learning models could predict movement patterns based on contextual information derived from the agent and its trajectories. During this time, I also completed a six-month internship at Amazon, during which I developed and deployed a Transformer-based system for real-time transit time estimation across the EU logistics network. This experience strengthened my ability to build scalable ML systems for production use.

                    The journey is far from over. I'm still as curious and driven as ever, eager to continue learning and pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the real world.

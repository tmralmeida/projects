                            I'm a learner that feels motivated by machine learning/deep learning,
                            computer science, artificial vision, and robotics.
                            The learning process is what I love most.

                    <p class="lead">
                        During my Master Thesis I studied Computer Vision methods for detecting road lanes/lines onboard
                        of an autonomous vehicle. Deep Learning emerged right from the start as one of the most viable/robust solutions to this problem.
                        But I had only heard about this topic in the halls... My advisor told me that there were deadlines to meet and I would need a lot of time
                        to learn Machine Learning (barely I knew how right he was). The rest is history:
                        I started there right away studying the high level of Deep Learning; when I finished my thesis I took several courses about
                        both Machine Learning and Deep Learning topics and today I am on the right track. However, there is still a world to discover and explore and
                        I am going to be a part of it!

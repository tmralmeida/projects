                              It arose during my research work at University of Aveiro, Portugal. In this project, I went through
                              every step of training a deep neural network: we collected data (images of this type of landmarks in different environmens);
                              we labeled that data through the <a href="https://labelbox.com/" class="tooltip-test">Labelbox app</a>; then, we trained and 
                              evaluated the Faster R-CNN model through the <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2" class="tooltip-test">
                              Detectron2 platform</a>, which is a research platform that contains several state-of the art models such as Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, 
                              RetinaNet, and DensePose, ready to use.

                              <p class="describe-projects">
                                The dataset is one of the most important pieces of the overall Machine Learning solution, since each decision of the model is based on 
                                a previous training, which is performed on that data. Therefore, if the training procedure has been compromised, then the inference quality of the model will be worse.
                                Thus, in this stage of the work, we labeled correctly 156 training frames and 224 test images. This distribution of training/test sets
                                is not either the most common one or the most correct one. However, the number of class objects to detect is just one, and, although it
                                is a small patch of the image, it is a pretty distinguishable object from the rest of the image. So, the training set is equally distributed
                                by two different environments: a common laboratory room with several objects spread around and a workshop with machinery. These choices allow to
                                obtain a more representative dataset. Regarding the test set, this is also equally distributed into two different enviroments: a hallway and a different
                                part of the workshop used in the training set.

                              We decided to use this architecture because this type of deep neural networks are very performants when the objective is to detect small patches in the image. 
                              Moreover, the system where this neural would be used (an Automated Guided Vehicle) does not move at high speeds, so the high-latency disadvantage of proposals networks
                              would not be a problem in this application. Thus, when you are in the phase of choosing which Machine Learning approach to use, you have to take into account the practical
                              application where you are working at (Deep Learning is sometimes overkill for some applications, Machine Learning is much more than  just Deep Learning).

                              The training procedure of a deep neural network can be divided into 3 main steps: data loading, forward propagation and back propagation. The first step in this work 
                              implied to register our dataset in the dataset catalog of Detectron2. This is no more than a function that translates our dataset in a dictionary with certain fields.
                              You can check all these steps in my <a href="https://github.com/tmralmeida/faster-rcnn-data-matrix/blob/master/faster-rcnn-data-matrix.ipynb" class="tooltip-test">notebook</a>.
                              Finally, the second and third steps, Detectron2 makes everything by us, we just need to know how to use their API and choose some hyperparameters such as: batch size, 
                              learning rate, and the number of iterations.

                              The evaluation of the model was also performed through the Detectron2 API. To do so, we evaluate our model trough the <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval"

                              The most important result in terms of overall is 0.876 for AP@0.5. Why? Because 0.5 is a fair value for the IoU threshold, the scales are all and the number maximum of 
                              detections is 100 (more than adequate value to match the reality). In addition, the recall is higher than the precision, implying that the number of false positives is 
                              higher than the number of false negatives. This means that, the model detects almost all the Data Matrix landmarks, but also detects some other objects that are not. In our
                              system this is preferable, since we use a Data Matrix decoder in a further step. So, if the object is not a Data Matrix, the decoder would return nothing. Comparing to the 
                              Data Matrix detection of the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylibdmtx/" class="tooltip-test">libdmtx Python library</a>, only 45% of the test set frames were accurately
                              processed by the classical algorithm, being 40 times slower than the model that we trined in this project.
